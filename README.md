## About the archival collection
Summary: Henry Watkins Allen (1820-1866) established the Allendale sugar plantation in West Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, in the early 1850s. Allendale Plantation changed hands several times over the years, until 1882, when John and Martin James Kahao purchased the land, buildings, and equipment. Seventy 5 x 7 copy prints of photographs found in the Kahao family scrapbook (retained by owner) include family photographs, scenes of Allendale Plantation buildings, workers, and sugar cane fields.
